    "\n",
    "+ Use a source of real randomness to set the seed with a substantial amount of entropy, e.g., 20 rolls of 10-sided dice.\n",
    "+ Record the seed so your analysis is reproducible.\n",
    "+ Use a PRNG at least as good as the Mersenne Twister, and preferably a cryptographic quality PRNG. Consider the PCG family. Avoid standard linear congruential generators and the Wichmann-Hill generator.\n",
    "+ Use open-source software, and record the version of the software you use.\n",
    "+ Use a sampling algorithm that does not \"waste randomness.\" Avoid permuting the entire population.\n",
    "+ Be aware of discretization issues in the sampling algorithm; many methods assume the PRNG produces $U[0,1]$ or $U[0,1)$ random numbers, rather than (an approximation to) numbers that are uniform on $w$-bit binary integers.\n",
    "+ Consider the size of the problem: are your PRNG and sampling algorithm adequate?\n",
    "+ Avoid \"tests of representativeness\" and procedures that reject some samples. They alter the distribution of the sample."
